Millie and Billy had gone to stay with their grandparents for a week in the summer as a treat. They had already had one day with grandma and grandpa that had been packed with fun. When they hopped out of bed the next morning they were excited, wondering what this second day would have in store for them. We have a special treat for you this sunny day grandpa said over breakfast. We are off to the seaside. Millie and Billy were thrilled. They helped grandma and grandpa to make up a picnic and put their buckets and spades in grandpas blue car. Then they were off. Grandma sat in the front of the car with grandpa, who was driving, and Millie and Billy sat in the back.
